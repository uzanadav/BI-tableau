This is a project I did in a university course of Business intelligence; in this project my teammates and I took a database of Cruise company called "Princes cruise". The database was made using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) filled with the company customers and reservation details.
We build Star schema with two facts tables and made all the ETL processes using Talend. At the end of the projects, we developed dashboards using Tableau.
